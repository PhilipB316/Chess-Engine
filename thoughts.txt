engine search depth 14

best position searched first, and finds fastest mate, gives score of 99993
the score for this best position is 99993, and has a search depth of 14

later positions are not as good. at a depth of 6 in one of these not as good positions, the engine comes across the same position as the current 'best position'.
it looks up the TT table, and discovers that exact position analysed at a depth of 14.
it takes that good score and returns it, failing to identify that doing so will result in mate (eventually),
but this will either require chance to end up in a position of mate in one, or will require exhausting every other possible move
