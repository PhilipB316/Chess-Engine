Chess Engine Outline

Parse position, generate:
- array with white pieces stored as chars located at corresponding indices
- array with black pieces stored as chars located at corresponding indices
- array with pieces (regardless of colour) stored as 1s (or 0s if not pieces) located at corresponding indices
- empty array for squares threatened by black pieces
- empty array for squares threatened by white pieces
- empty array for possible moves of a colour stored as Move_t


Parse piece list:
    for piece in piece_list:
        for direction (for piece):
            if current_square + direction_offset*counter = empty_square:
                possible_moves_list.append 

Use algebra and square notation to determine all possible moves per piece
Use algebra and square notation to determine all squares threatened per piece
